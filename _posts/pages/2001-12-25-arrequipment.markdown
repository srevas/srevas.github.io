## A.R.Rahman's studio equipment

Being an audio geek, I've always been curious about the evolution of
A.R.Rahman's recording setup over the years. I first started researching and cataloging
whatever I saw in interviews (which he often did at [Panchathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchathan_Record_Inn_and_AM_Studios), seated
in front of his equipment) around 1998, which, incidentally was also around the
time I joined the A.R.Rahman Yahoo! (then eGroups) [fan
group](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arrahmanfans/) and
the A.R.Rahman web ring - both started by [Gopal Srinivasan](http://gopalhome.tripod.com/arrpage.html).

While I don't actively maintain this page anymore, I do add stuff to
it from time to time.

### Keyboards

#### Korg M1 [^1]
![Korg M1](/images/arr/keyboard-korg-m1.jpg)

Introduced back in 1988, the M1’s popularity steadily grew to exceed
an amazing 100,000 users. As the first workstation synthesizer, it was
a definitive element in the sound of the late ‘80s through early
‘90s. Along with its innovative "workstation" concept, the M1's "AI"
(Advanced Integrated) synthesis system used PCM waveforms and digital
effects to deliver fully complete program and combination sounds. As a
pioneer of PCM tone generation, it was notable not just for the
reality of its sound, but also for the distinctive resonance and tonal
character that demonstrated the high level of Korg's voicing
technology. From the famous "M1 Piano" sound through electric pianos,
organs, synth pads, drums, and picked basses, numerous sounds
available only from the M1 were taken up by musicians and producers
around the world, and are still in use today. Although today's high
bit-rate and high sample-rate sound libraries deliver greatly improved
audio quality, it is difficult to find sounds with real presence,
sounds that can’t be described purely in terms of specifications –
sounds that are available only from the M1. The M1 software
synthesizer reconstructs the M1's sound engine into an eight-part
multi-timbral tone generator featuring up to 256-note polyphony. 

The M1 software synthesizer is a complete stand alone virtual
instrument; and also supports RTAS, Audio Units and VST plug-in
formats to fit smoothly into a modern music production environment.

#### Korg O1/W [^1]
![Korg O1/W](/images/arr/keyboard-korg-o1w.jpg)

The Korg 01/W was a workstation synthesizer, released in 1991, and was
intended to replace the M1 and T series. The workstation/ROMpler was
based on AI, an improved version of the AI (Advanced Integrated)
Synthesis technology found in the M1. The success of the AI
architecture ensured it was used in the majority of subsequent Korg
synths of the 1990s.

#### Korg Triton [^2]
![Korg Triton](/images/arr/keyboard-korg-triton.jpg)

The Korg Triton was a music workstation synthesizer, featuring digital
sampling and sequencing, released in 1999. It used Korg's HI Synthesis
tone generator and was eventually available in several model variants
with numerous upgrade options. The Triton became renowned as a
benchmark of keyboard technology, and has been widely featured in
music videos and live concerts. At the NAMM 2007, Korg announced the
Korg M3 as its successor.

#### Roland XV88 [^1]
![Roland XV88](/images/arr/keyboard-roland-xv88.jpg)

The XV-88 was Roland's flagship synthesizer. It featured 128-voices of
powerful XV sounds, an 88-note precision hammer-action keyboard,
D-Beam controller, and expandability via 64MB* SRX- and popular
SR-JV80-Series wave expansion boards.

The Fantom G is a Sampling Synth Workstation with Advanced Sound
Engine, ARX SuperNATURAL Expansion Bays, Large Graphic Interface,
128-track Sequencer, and Multi-FX.

#### Korg Kronos
![Korg Kronos](/images/arr/keyboard-korg-kronos.jpg)

The Kronos is a music workstation manufactured by Korg that combines
nine different synthesizer sound engines with a sequencer, digital
recorder, effects, a color touchscreen display and a keyboard.

Much like Kronos' predecessor and Korg's previous flagship synthesizer
workstation, the OASYS, Kronos is basically a custom software
synthesizer running on an Intel x86 processor and operating system
based on the Linux kernel with RTAI extensions; It includes 9
different sound engines which encompass the entire range of Korg
synthesis technologies.
